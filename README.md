# reactidd

This repository contains code and data from the REal Time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study.

It is structured as an R package and is most easily installed using the `install_github` in the package `dev_tools`. 
However the data are also directly available from the `inst\extdata`as `csv` files.
